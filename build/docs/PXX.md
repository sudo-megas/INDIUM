# PXX — the round that ends the beta

*In progress. This document accumulates as the round runs; it is not finished until Phase 4.*

Every round before this one shipped a feature or closed a defect, and each is numbered for that
reason. This one ships no feature. It is the step where the program is examined and either earns
the right to stop calling itself a beta or does not, and it stands outside the numbered sequence
deliberately.

The condition it answers has stood in §7 since P18 and has never been met: *"the `1.0` line stays
one until the design work it is named for has been in real hands"* — the gate being **a testing
round against a released build carrying it**. The design work is P12's and P13's, shipped at
`v1.0.0-4`. `v2.1`, published 2026-08-13, is a released build carrying it. P19, P20 and P21 each
recorded the gate as deferred and left it as the maker's call. This is that call.

## Phase 1 — the suite, run against what shipped

Nothing in this phase is new code. It is the first complete run the project has ever had.

The build under test is **`v2.1`**, downloaded from its own release page rather than rebuilt:
`indium-2.1.0-1-x86_64.pkg.tar.zst` (10,319,410 B), `indium_2.1.0-1_amd64.deb` (7,282,304 B) and
`indium-2.1.0-1-x86_64.tar.gz` (9,774,204 B), each matching the size the release records. The
tarball's binary was unpacked into `target/release/` — `release.yml`'s own recipe — so the ELF
checks and the §2 toolkit gate read the binary that actually ships instead of skipping.

| What | Command | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| The default suite | `cargo test` | **334 passed, 0 failed**, 10 ignored |
| The packages, read by INDIUM itself | `INDIUM_PKG=… INDIUM_DEB=… cargo test --test package_path -- --ignored` | **8 passed** |
| The estimator, on the 3450U | `cargo test --release --lib the_eight_candidates -- --ignored --nocapture` | **1 passed** |
| The Wayland clipboard | `cargo test --lib -- --ignored offer_reaches_the_wayland_clipboard` | **1 passed** |
| Both packages | `verify.sh`, both env vars set | **40 passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped** |
| The §2 gate | `check-deps.sh` | toolkit-free · PIE, BIND_NOW |
| Formatting | `cargo fmt --check` | clean |
| Lints | `cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings` | clean |

**344 of 344.** Every test the repository contains has now been run and passed at once, which had
never happened before. The ten ignored tests divide three ways, and no single environment had
ever satisfied all three: **eight** (`tests/package_path.rs`) want release artefacts that do not
exist until a tag is pushed; **one** (`platform/clipboard.rs:174`) wants a live Wayland session
and a `wl-paste` no CI runner has; **one** (`estimate.rs:977`) wants a `--release` build and quiet
CPU time, and is a measurement of a particular machine rather than an assertion CI would learn
anything from. CI can reach the eight and can never reach the Wayland one. A person's machine can
reach the Wayland one and the estimator, and had never been pointed at the eight. This is the
first time all three were true at once.

`verify.sh` reporting **zero skipped** is the part worth naming. A skip there is not a pass — it
is a check that found nothing to look at — and the two ELF checks skip by default precisely when
nobody has put a shipped binary where they look.

### What the estimator measured, and one thing it found

Eight candidates over this repository's own `src/`, **936.1 KiB weighed whole** (under the 2 MiB
budget, so not sampled):

| Method | Level | Time | Ratio |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Store | 0 | 18 ms | 103.0% |
| lz4 | 1 | 11 ms | 45.8% |
| gzip | 6 | 47 ms | 28.7% |
| zstd | 3 | 8 ms | 28.3% |
| bzip2 | 9 | 86 ms | 20.1% |
| xz | 6 | 496 ms | 22.5% |
| LZMA2 | 6 | 423 ms | 28.7% |
| Deflate | 6 | 36 ms | 31.4% |

**1125 ms in total**, of which xz and LZMA2 are 81.7%.

`estimate.rs:58-62` records the previous measurement and reasons from it:

> Measured rather than guessed … **1365 ms for 813 KiB**, of which xz (571) and LZMA2 (566) are
> 83%. That scales to roughly **3.5 s** at this budget, and doubling the budget doubles that wait
> for a figure nobody reads twice.

Both halves have drifted. The input is no longer 813 KiB — `src/` has grown to 936.1 KiB — and
the time is no longer 1365 ms but 1125. Carried through the same arithmetic the docstring
performs, 2 MiB now costs **roughly 2.5 s, not 3.5**. The paragraph is honest about being a
record of one measurement, so it is not false; it is stale, and it is stale in the one place that
matters, because the figure exists to justify `BUDGET`'s size and a reader deciding whether to
double it would be reasoning from a 40% overestimate.

This is the shape P22 already met once, when `LZMA2:19` was found copied into two docstrings and
into §4.1 itself. A figure written down by hand beside the code that produces it drifts silently;
the fix P22 chose was to make the test read the document rather than let a person copy from it.
Recorded here for the audit to rule on rather than closed now.

## Phase 2 — the instrument, the corpus, and the sheet

### The instrument

`build/docs/TESTPLAN.md` — **153 steps across 14 rounds**. P11 and P12 ran eight rounds and
forty-one steps against `v1.0.0-2` and `v1.0.0-3` on the night of 9–10 August and every step
passed, and that list was never checked in. It survives only as quoted fragments inside `P11.md`
and in `~/indium-test/OBSERVATIONS.md`, which is how a program comes to be certified by an
instrument nobody can produce afterwards. Twenty-six steps here carry that round's mark: fourteen
of the originals survive as verbatim quotations in the maker's own record, and the rest are
recovered from its findings and from the six coordinates `P11.md` names them at. There are more
marked rows than recovered originals because several originals are split — a step that bundled
four expectations into one line hid which of the four had failed.

### Three steps that were wrong before anyone walked them

Worth recording, because each was found by checking the plan against the program rather than by
running it, and a plan that tells the walker to expect the wrong thing produces a false denial.

- **3.9** said the password popup for `secret.7z` appears *at the moment of use, not at open*.
  It is the other way round. That archive has **encrypted headers** — `bsdtar -tf` refuses it too,
  with *"The archive header is encrypted"* — so the listing is itself the moment of use and the
  prompt comes at open. Not a quirk of the fixture either: `sevenz.rs:294` calls
  `set_encrypt_header(recipe.encrypt)`, so **every archive INDIUM encrypts behaves this way**.
  A walker following the old wording would have denied a correct program.
- **12.6** said to *"watch for `ENOSPC`"*, which is an observation and not something anyone can
  approve or deny. Running out of room on a 712 MB tmpfs is the expected outcome; what is being
  tested is how INDIUM ends. The step now says: approve if it reports the failure in a sentence,
  leaves nothing half-written and keeps the window usable; deny if it hangs, dies silently,
  claims success, or leaves a partial file it does not mention.
- **12.8** asked for `VmPeak` without giving the command to read it. It now carries one, and says
  why `VmPeak` rather than `VmHWM`: under 99 GiB of swap, resident high-water caps near physical
  RAM and measures the box instead of the program.

A fourth gap was structural rather than factual. `bigsecret.7z` was to be *"sized by agent 2"* —
but agent 2 belongs to Phase 3, and the maker opens the archive during Phase 2's walk. Resolved
by making the build a step of its own: the generator writes an 8 GiB input file, **12.8 builds the
archive through Create → Encrypted**, and 12.9 reads it back. There is no `7z` binary and no
`py7zr` on this machine, so INDIUM writing it is not setup for the test — it *is* the test, on the
write path.

### The corpus

`build/make-testdata.sh`, checked in; the fixtures themselves are not, and are gigabytes. Sizes
are chosen against a boundary rather than for bulk:

| Fixture | Size | What it is there to find |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `under-limit.tar` | 943,718,400 B of content | Under `scratch.rs`'s hardcoded 1 GiB `RAM_LIMIT`, so a copy-out routes to `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` — a **712 MB tmpfs**, smaller than the payload |
| `over-limit.tar` | 1,610,612,736 B | Over the same limit, routing to cache instead: the other side of a branch nothing has exercised at scale |
| `big-mixed.tar.zst` | 3.0 GB, 209 members | Half incompressible by design, so zstd cannot shrink it and Measure has real bytes to weigh |
| `many-entries.tar` | 150,000 entries | The virtualized table, the filter, Select-all |
| `deep.tar` | 20 KB | 60 levels, a 250-character component, names with spaces, tabs, a newline, Turkish and emoji — **and four traversal members** |
| `bigsecret-input.bin` | 8 GiB, sparse | Larger than this machine's 7.0 GiB of RAM, so the member provably cannot be held in memory — the claim `arch.rs:1038` makes with its `usize::MAX` read. Costs no disk at all |

The filler is an **AES-CTR keystream under a fixed pass phrase**, not `/dev/urandom`, so two runs
on two machines produce identical bytes and a figure measured here can be compared with one
measured elsewhere. That matters for a defect whose report has to say what happens on a machine
with less swap than this one. Total real cost: **5.7 GB**, leaving 71 GB free on `/home`. R9's
overflow partition was offered and is not needed at these sizes.

`deep.tar`'s four traversal members — two `../`, one via a middle component, one absolute — are
there because `path_escapes` (`arch.rs:940-946`) has never been fed a hostile path by anything but
its own unit test. **New step 3.13** extracts them, names its throwaway target twice, and denies on
any file landing outside it. It is the only step in the plan that could write outside its target.

### The sheet

`build/make-checksheet.py` reads `TESTPLAN.md` and emits `build/docs/checksheet.html` — one row
per step, a two-button verdict, a note, live tallies per round and overall, filters for unanswered
and denied, and a block at the foot that builds the text to paste back with denials first. State
is in `localStorage`, so a closed tab loses nothing.

**It is generated, not transcribed**, and that is the whole point: this round already found
`estimate.rs:58` stale for exactly the reason P22 found `LZMA2:19` stale, and a 153-row checklist
copied by hand is that hazard with more rows. Closing a denial is one edit to the plan and one
command. Output is byte-identical across runs, so a rebuilt sheet diffs cleanly against the one
before it.

Published as a private artifact for the walk:
<https://claude.ai/code/artifact/52fad8f7-72f5-4318-9e55-9224c3995de3>

**The gate (R3).** Every denial becomes work in this round — fixed, re-verified and re-ticked.
Phase 3 does not begin until the sheet is clean.
